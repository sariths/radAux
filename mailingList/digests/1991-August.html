Subject: Polygon primitive
To: GJWard@Csa2.lbl.gov

Regarding my raving earlier about the ordering of polygons for the direction
of facet normal...how about a special polygon primitive which is defined
as double sided, it is really two polygons with the same vertices but one
ordered clockwise and the other anticlockwise. It seems better to make this
a primitive that the renderer "knows" about than to have the data files
include both polygons. Does Radiance handle coincident polygons like that
descibed above?
Also I am fustrated by renderers which don't know about lines and therefore
force me to turn lines into cylinders. It would seem nicer for the renderer
to turn them into cylinders of radius = 1 pixel, ie: normally the modelling
or translator software does not know the pixel size (image space not world)

Hi Paul,

As I said in an earlier mail, Radiance ignores polygon "sidedness" for all
material types except dielectric.  Thus, most polygons in fact act as though
they are two-sided during rendering.  Dielectric objects must be modeled as
solids, since light refraction happens on entry and on exit, and a two-sided
polygon would be equivalent to an infinitely thin volume, which should be
modeled instead by the material "glass" that is designed for this purpose
and that ignores surface orientation.

The hack used by most scanline renderers of culling back-facing polygons
does not really help that much in a ray tracer so I felt that all faces
should be treated as two-sided in Radiance.  This makes the modelers job
a lot easier (whether it be a modeler programmer like youself or some poor
fool like me using a text editor).

To answer your question, "does Radiance handle coincident surfaces?" I would
have to say no.  There is a well-known problem in ray tracing which is 
avoiding a reintersection with a surface upon reflection or refraction.
For polygons, it is an easy decision not to test the intersected surface
again for intersection, but spheres and other curved surfaces can have
multiple intersection and the decision is not so straightforward.  The
nicest way to avoid this problem is to insist that the first intersection
be some minimum distance from the starting point, which precludes the
possibility of properly handling coincident surfaces as well.  I could
discuss this topic in more detail, but I see my letter running off the
top of the screen and sense that I should move on.

Drawing lines does not make sense for a physically-based rendering program
because lines in fact do not exist.  I suppose true two-dimensional surfaces
don't exist either, but for the purpose of light interaction they are a
fair approximation of the real world.  Physics aside, it is not easy in
a ray-tracer to decide which pixels to paint with a line because the
rays go into the scene from the pixels and may not even be aware when
they pass close to a line.  Line drawing works much better the other
way where you start with the world coordinates of the line and draw
a nice pixel-width object on the image.  Believe it or not, Radiance
sometimes does not even know what the pixel size is because it is
frequently used in a luminance mode where it is not generating an image
but is being used instead to calculate light levels.  Also, since lines
are non-physical, it would not be possible to shade them properly and
they would wind up as these anomolous glowing objects in an otherwise
natural-looking scene.

For the purpose of rendering with a ray-tracer, it really makes the
most sense to convert the lines into cylinders as you do and
give them a radius that makes the most sense of the size of the
object the lines are meant to represent, ie. grass or sticks or
whatever.  The lines may show up as thicker up close and thinner
(or dissappearing) at a distance, but this is the nature of physical
reality.  Setting the line width proplerly usually means leaving it
to the user.

I have been using radiance a bit now although generally in a simple minded
way, I do have a question on which you may have some suggestions.

What is the "nicest way" to include parameters in a scene description. For 
example, define some constants which are used thoughout the scene description.
This would allow the user to change the constants to meet his/her needs.
A real example, I would like to define a constant called RADIUS say, this
would be used thoughout the geometry description of cylinders and spheres.

Hi Paul,

I have considered from time to time adding variables to the scene description
but never did it.  I guess I wanted to keep the job of parsing the scene
files as simple as possible for other programs/programmers who might want
to use the information.

The first method that occurs to me for adding variables to the input file is
with the C language preprocessor, /usr/lib/cpp, or better yet the macro
processor m4.  This will allow you to define variables as well as (macro)
functions with arguments.  I have not tried this myself, but I see no reason
why it wouldn't work.

Thanks for the reply, I didn't think that parameters were possible in the
Radiance scene description but thought I would check in case there were
some as yet undocumented features.
 
You may have noticed a new version of Vision3D in the Mac FTP folder. If not
then you may want to change the file privileges.
 
Has anyone else to your knowledge written a translator from Super3D (another
Mac modeller, not all that powerful but widely used, it is to 3d modelling
what Lotus is to speadsheets - the product to which others are compared). I
have worked on one over the last week for a project here, before I develop
it much further I would like to make sure there is not already something
out there.
 
I'll send you a GIF sometime soon of some 3D L-System plants I've been
working on recently. They look quite good I think, the application that
allows the user to specify the production rules, etc, exports to Radiance.

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the new version of Vision3D.  I did noticed it and renamed
the files, getting rid of the old one and updating the README file.
I have since made the README file in that directory writable so you
can modify it if you like.

I have had a student working (for some time) on translating the Renderman
output of Sculp3D into Radiance format, but I don't know off hand of anyone
who has worked with Super3D files.

You can drop GIF (Targa, PICT, Sun rasterfile, Radiance pictures) off
in the pub/xfer directory on hobbes with anonymous ftp.  Which reminds
me, I need to write some new image format translators...  My prediction
for computer science is that in two years the hardware industry will
abandon the ASCII standard and the QWERTY keyboard and the few bitter
programmers left will spend all their time hacking on new viruses.

  Hello Greg,

  Are you aware of any RADIANCE functions that *roughly* approximate
  atmospheric effects ?  I have been generating some landscape scenes,
  and then post-processing to add the atmospheric effects.  It would
  handy to be able to add atmospherics at time of rendering.

Hi Jerrell,

If by atmospheric effects you are referring to scattering, absorption, etc.,
the answer is no, Radiance does not support it.  You can, however, model
high clouds and other patterns in the sky directly in Radiance.  If this
is what you are after, I can give you some hints and examples in another
letter.  For now, I'll assume that what you want is the former.

The best post-process to get a rough approximation to scattering (and/or
absorption) would use the -z option of rpict to produce a file of pixel
distances then use this information to modify the colors in the final
picture.  This would be done most efficiently by a special purpose program,
but you can do it also with the existing tools pvalue and pcomb.

By way of example, let's say you want to imitate haze that fades to white
as an exponential function of distance.  You would first render an ordinary
image with rpict, using the -z option to produce a distance file, like so:

% rpict -x 512 -y 480 -z scene.z scene.oct > scene.pic

Then you would use pvalue together with pcomb to apply the desired function
to the pixels based on their distance.  Pvalue is necessary to convert the
machine floating point numbers in the z-file into a Radiance picture 
because pcomb only works on this format.

% pvalue -r -b -h -df -x 512 -y 480 scene.z | \
	pcomb -e 'ro=f(ri(2));go=f(gi(2));bo=f(bi(2))' \
		-e 'f(p)=c*p+1-c;c=exp(-gi(1)/udist)' \
		-e 'udist=50.0' - scene.pic > scene.fade.pic

Note that it is necessary to repeat the image size to pvalue so it knows
what to do with scene.z.  The unit fade-out distance "udist" can be
changed from 50.0 to whatever you like to provide the desired fade-out.

If you tell me what kind of effects you desire (perhaps after some
experimentation), I may even write a program to do it more efficiently
for you (still as a post-process, though).  I never did much with
atmospherics because most of my scenes are indoors, and I prefer to
create accurate physical simulations rather than quick hacks.
However, atmospherics is one thing I don't expect to be able to treat
correctly within Radiance in the near future, so a hack is the best
I can do.

LARGE	Large Radiance Models

Date: Mon, 1 Jul 91 12:01:59 NZT
From: arch2@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz
Subject: Large Radiance Models
To: greg@hobbes.lbl.gov

Hi,

I have been trying to get Radiance to work with models containing
about 10,000 spheres, stored in a text file of about 1M, and keep
getting the "out of octree" space message from oconv.

In your first Radiance digest you suggest ways of increasing the
size of models oconv can handle. None of these seem to do the
trick.

I have tried these values:
    MAXOBJBLK in object.h is 65535
    MAXOBLK   in octree.h is 524287
    OSTSIZ    in objset.c is 1047821 (It is prime)

I also changed OBJECT to a long.

oconv dies with this message:
    oconv: system - out of octree space: Not enough space

According to ps -l oconv uses up to about 2,500K of memory. (The machine has
64M and I am allowed a maximum of 10M). The exit code is 2, if it helps.  

Also, what does the '-n' parameter do. On my "smaller" models '-n 7' or
similar stopped the error message.

Thanks in advance,
Russell (for Paul Bourke)

Subject: Re:  Large Radiance Models

Hi Russell (and Paul?),

I think your problems with oconv must be due to memory limitations, since
it is a malloc failure that is stopping the process.  If you can't find
any other system variables or administrative things that our limiting
your process size (Cray's operating system places limits on interactive
sessions, for example), then you might try replacing the COMPAT=malloc.o
to COMPAT=bmalloc.o in ray/src/{rt,ot}/Makefile and recompiling.  This
will use the system version of malloc rather than my home-grown routines.
Sometimes people do some pretty strange things with memory allocation.

The -n parameter to oconv makes the octree place more surfaces into the
octree voxels.  It is a good idea to increase this number for very complex
scenes if memory is a problem.  You can jack it up to around 16 with little
degradation in rendering time -- at least for spheres.

I am still having "fun" with my large models.

Would splitting the .rad file into smaller pieces and using
oconv to merge them together help?

Some of the programs I ran today wanted 64M of memory -- they
were run in batch mode where processes are allowed that much memory.

Thanks,

Russell

Subject: Re:  Large Radiance Models

Hi Russell,

Thank you for the details on the oconv errors.  Oconv should be able to
handle 10,000 non-intersecting spheres quite easily.  Your spheres must
be intersecting an awful lot or you are using more spheres than you claim
to be running over 64 Mbytes of memory!

Things you can do about it:

1) Change your scene generator so as to avoid generating so many
intersecting spheres.

2) Increase the -n parameter of oconv to 120.

3) Decrease the -r parameter of oconv by half or so.  (This will
cause a set overflow error if you decrease it too much.)

4) Try generating the octree in stages (as you suggested) by giving
oconv progressively more spheres to add to the scene.  You may have
to use the -b option on the initial run of oconv to tell it what you
expect the eventual scene boundaries to be.

5) Use the Radiance instance type to duplicate sections of your scene
rather than enumerating everything.  This is the best method to achieve
geometric complexity without using up all available memory.  You simply
create a fraction of the scene you want, then instantiate it throughout
the environment.  Using heirarchical instancing, it is easy to create
models with many millions of surfaces.

Let me know if I can be of any more help.

this is mike stephens at waterways experiment station (wes) in vicksburg, miss.
i just got the 5th release of your program radiance 1.4 and plan to use it

(svc).

i have tried to compile it on our sgi (4D) boxes and have run into some

installed radiance on?

i get errors in the 'malloc.c' routine (v_pageshift not defined)

Hi Mike,

You need to change the COMPAT=malloc.o to COMPAT=bmalloc.o in the
Makefiles in the src/rt and src/ot directories.  The memory stuff
has not been very well standardized under System V, so some of the
definitions in my malloc.c cause trouble for some implementations.
The routines in tty.c are really written for BSD derivatives, and
don't work for any System V Unix's, but this module is only used
by the AED 512 driver, which you probably don't need.  I guess I
made an error in my makeall script and included this driver when
I shouldn't have.  Anyway, it just won't be made properly --
everything else should work fine.  If you want, you can change
the line in makeall under the Silicon Graphics IRIS choice from
special="aed" to special=

I have never tried to compile 1.4 on an IRIS, just 1.3.  I no longer
have easy access to an IRIS workstation.  (Actually, I have never
had easy access to anything except a Sun 3/60.)

Hope this helps!

the malloc problem could have been solved by yours truly if

oh, well....

instead of the bmalloc=>malloc solution for the sgi anyway
i changed malloc.c so that getpagesize was called as a system

which is in <sys/types.h> in irix 3.3.2.

Hi Sigge,

Radiance runs under A/UX (Apple's UNIX) on the Mac II family.  Since
most folks use the ordinary Mac OS, this doesn't do much good.  But,
if you're interested in A/UX for the MacIntosh, it's not all that
expensive and Radiance will run on it.  I've been using a Mac IIfx
myself successfully to do animations using Radiance.

A/UX costs around $500 in the US and X11 software is another $200 or so.
The main drawback is that it requires 80+ Mbytes of disk space and X11
doesn't run well unless you have at least 8 Mbytes of RAM.  Also,
installation is difficult unless you buy it already installed on an
Apple external drive (very expensive).  CD-ROM is the next best
installation method.  You don't want the floppy disk product!

Dear Scott,

Sure enough, the critical file "proof" was missing from the distribution.
An over-zealous cleanup job on my part, I'm afraid.  I've added it back

ftp'ing it again (though it's small), I'll send you the file in the next

The rayinit.cal file (and other essential library files) come in the ray/lib
directory of the distribution.  They are not deleted by any cleanup procedure
I wrote, but you may not have remembered to set the RAYPATH environment
variable to tell the programs where to find this directory.  The makeall
script is supposed to do this automatically, but it only works if you
tell it to go ahead and install the library in the location you select.
You can always set the RAYPATH variable manually with a line in your
.login file like so:

	setenv RAYPATH .:/installpath/ray/lib

Where "installpath" is replaced with the place you installed the distribution.

Hope this helps!

Hi, Greg:

Thanking you for your mail of July 31.  I tried to grab Radiance at midnight,
and successfully got everything I need.

After I installed the Radiance, I found *rview* didn't get compiled.  I also
checked the *devtable.c*, and the default_driver is x11_init(), though I 
replied "no x10 support" during the installation.  I modified default_driver
of devtable.c to *sun*, but *make  rview* still doesn't work properly.

The other thing is how to specify the focal length with the command *rpict*.
I checked the reference manual and relevant manual pages, but couldn't find
any direct way to do that. 

Could you please give me some hint to my questions.

BTW, we use a sparc-2 station with a 24-bit graphics adaptor which is compatible

Hi Junan,

I have had this asked of me before, so I decided to make a little readme

There is no adjustment for focal length, since the renderers do not have
depth of field in their simple pinhole camera model.  If you want this,
you will have to add it yourself.  [But see PINTERP topic below -G]

(ie.  a /usr/include/X11 directory and /usr/lib/libX11.a library).
If this is not the case, you will have to make a couple of changes
to the files in the src/rt directory to make "rview" compile properly.  
If you are a thorough person, you can also make changes to the Makefile's
in the src/util and src/px directory to avoid some other spurious but
unimportant errors.

The following diffs should be applied to Makefile and devtable.c in the
src/rt subdirectory:

============= rt/Makefile =============
35c35
< DOBJS = devtable.o devcomm.o editline.o x11.o x11twind.o \
---
> DOBJS = devtable.o devcomm.o \
37c37
< DSRC = devtable.c devcomm.c editline.c x11.c x11twind.c \
---
> DSRC = devtable.c devcomm.c \
39c39
< DLIBS = -lX11
---
> DLIBS = 

============= rt/devtable.c =============
15c15
< char  dev_default[] = "x11";
---
> char  dev_default[] = "sun";
17,18d16
< extern struct driver  *x11_init();
< 
23c21
< 	{"x11", "X11 color or greyscale display", x11_init},
---
> 	{"x11", "X11 color or greyscale display", comm_init},

These changes may be applied to the Makefile's in the src/util and
src/px subdirectories for cleaner compilation:

=============== px/Makefile =============
19c19
< ra_t8 ra_bn ra_t16 pcomb pinterp ximage xshowtrace pflip
---
> ra_t8 ra_bn ra_t16 pcomb pinterp xshowtrace pflip

=============== util/Makefile ============
13c13
< PROGS = makedist swaprasheader findglare xglaresrc glarendx
---
> PROGS = makedist swaprasheader findglare glarendx

Greg:
	I just picked up Radiance. Look's interesting. I found the following
missing:

	obj/model.new/rayinit.cal
	obj/cabin/tree.rad  - landscape wants to instanciate tree.oct
	
	I have done alot yet, did go back & pick up some .pic files
	& pub/objects/gjward.tar.Z

	I have not been able to assertain (from Raytracing News or your
	package) whether you generate "lit" polygons with soft shadows,
	which you can then walk through. The advantage of a Radiosity
	system is you only need to recompute the sceen if the lights or
	objects are moved, but not for camera moves.

good work,

Hello Frank,

It sounds like you need to set the environment variable RAYPATH to
the location of the library directory because it's not in the default
location /usr/local/lib/ray.  The README file should explain it, but
basically you need a line in your .login like:

	setenv RAYPATH .:/my/radiance/path/lib

Then the problems you mentioned should go away.

As for soft shadows, the default options of rpict produce sharp shadows,
but you can set the following if you want soft shadows:

	-sp 1 -dj .5

The -sp 1 value turns off image plane sampling, so the renderings will
take substantially longer.  Also, if you don't do any anti-aliasing by
running the result through pfilt and reducing the resolution, the shadows
will appear noisy.

I am aware that soft shadows and walk-through animations are big advantages
of radiosity methods, but then you're stuck with simple polygonal scenes
and diffuse surfaces, so it's a tradeoff.  I have implemented a z-buffer
interpolation program, pinterp, for generating walk-through animations that
makes ray tracing a reasonable way to go, actually.  It would be nice to
store all that shadow information somehow in the scene, but the memory
requirements are daunting.  We're running these programs on small machines,
too you know.

Thanks for your input.

For our computer vision project, we are using Radiance to model a
finite size pinhole by making lots of images from different points in
the pinhole and then adding them up, accounting for the shifts in pixel
location. Apart from writing new code, is this the only way to do this?

Hi Holly,

Regrettably, I can't think of any more direct way to do pinhole sampling
than what you're doing already.  However, there is a way you can do it
a little faster, I think.  Generate an image from the center using rpict
with the -z option to generate a z-file.  Then, use pinterp with the
following options to produce images at different points like so:

	% rpict [opts] [view] -x xres -y yres -z scene.z scene.oct > scene.pic
	% pinterp -vf scene.pic -vp x1 y1 z1 -vs h1 -vl v1 -x xres -y yres \
		-ff -r "[opts] scene.oct" scene.pic scene.z > scene1.pic

Pinterp just moves the pixels around according to the new viewpoint using
a z-buffer approach and calling on rtrace (in this case) to compute
pixels it cannot find.  The only problem with this technique is that it
does not correctly follow specular reflections in the new image, so if
you are trying to see depth of field in a reflection you need to wait
for rpict.

Also, you can use the view shift and lift parameters to do the pixel
shifting for you.  You just have to compute the appropriate values based
on the distance to your pinhole's image plane.  I would work out the
formulas for you, but I'm sure I'd make some dumb error.

Finally, I would recommend using pcomb to add the images up if you aren't
using it already.  You can give a scalefactor of 1/N for each image
and when you pass it through pfilt later you should get the correct
radiance values.

Let me know if I can be of any help, and thanks very much for sending
the report and the announcement.

-Greg
