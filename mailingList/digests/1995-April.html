Dear Radiance Users,

Here is a long-overdue digest of mail between myself and some of you,
dating back to October of last year.  Because I've been so derelict
in my moderator's duties, I had to break this into two parts since one
part exceeded the 100K limit on many mailers.  The second part, however,
consists of just one discussion, which is rather long-winded and highly
speculative.  I figured there would be only a few people interested in
that one, so I put it in a separate, ready-to-delete message.

As usual, the digest is broken into easily searched topics.  This message
contains discussions on the following topics:

Dr. Ward,
we have a short and simple question:
How do we get the direct irradiance and diffuse irradiance in 
W/m/m in Radiance 2.3 ?

Thanks Kathrin and Christof

Subject: Re:  radiance

Radiance computes only total irradiance, using the -I or -i options of rtrace.
If you wish to separate &quot;direct and diffuse&quot; for daylight calculation purposes,
you must perform two calculations using different executions of gensky.
For direct only, you must remove the sky source description and/or turn the
interreflection calculation in rtrace off by setting -ab 0 -av 0 0 0.
For diffuse only, you can use the -s option of gensky to remove the sun
source, or simply do a full calculation and subtract the direct component
computed above.

I hope this makes some sense.  I realize that it is confusing.  The chief
difference between Radiance and other lighting programs is that Radiance
will not calculate anything that cannot be measured.  Direct only and
diffuse only portions can only be approximately measured by shading the
photosensor from the solar direct.  You can do this in Radiance also
by creating a small shield in front of the sun source, if you like.

Subject: Generating sky in RADIANCE

Greg:

     I'm involved in a forestry remote sensing project in which
we're trying to use RADIANCE to generate false color scenes of a
natural forest in LANDSAT Thematic Mapper Bands (#2:0.52-0.62um
{mapped to blue}, #3:0.63-0.69um {mapped to green}, and #4:0.75-
0.88um {mapped to red}). I need to better understand how GENSKY
functions in order to set the direct solar flux and diffuse
skylight in these bands. To assist in determining direct and
diffuse irradiance values in these bands I'm using the atmospheric
model LOWTRAN7. Below is an example .RAD file output from GENSKY,
with some added documentation comments, followed by some questions.

Questions:

1. Direct Solar Flux. Turbidity was systematically manipulated from
1 to 10. Zenith brightness (variable A2 in skybright.cal) and
ground plane brightness (variable A3) both increase with turbidity
as expected. However, the RGB solar values were constant (at
6.88e+06) for all bands for all turbidity values. This was
unexpected - as aerosol turbidity increases diffuse irradiance
increases and direct solar flux decreases. Where does the value
6.88e+06 come from and why is it the same across all 3 bands and
for all turbidity values?  This is considerably higher than the red
green or blue direct irradiance estimates from LOWTRAN7, although
it is very close to the broadband visible radiance (0.4-0.7 um)
value predicted by LOWTRAN7. Where should I be substituting in 
estimates of direct spectral flux in other bands?

2. Diffuse Irradiance. How is A2 (1.33e+01 in example above)
computed and what does it represent? It appears very close to
zenith sky irradiance in the visible band (0.4-0.7um) predicted by
LOWTRAN.  How does (or should) it relate to RGB values in skyglow?
Should the spectral irradiances (RGB) be summed to equal A2?

Any help you can give me on these questions would be greatly
appreciated.

Subject: Re:  Generating sky in RADIANCE

Hi Bruce,

In order to better understand the ouput of gensky and its meaning, you should
refer to the file &quot;skybright.cal&quot; in the src/gen directory, which should be
duplicated also in your Radiance library directory (wherever that is).
I assume you have done this already, based on the questions you posed.

Let me start by saying that I have little confidence in the sky or solar
luminance calculations of gensky.  They are based on some simple rule-of-thumb
calculations and mean sky measurements taken years ago.  If you are serious
about your sky model (and it appears that you are), you should insert your own
values for sky and solar luminance via the -b and -r (or -B and -R) options
to gensky.  This will override the turbidity calculation for zenith luminance,
which as you noted, does not affect solar luminance as it ought.

If you have access to LOWTRAN, I would recommend that you stick with its
calculations for the relevant luminances.  You will find even that the CIE-
recommended model for clear and overcast skies is not very accurate.  It
is used more as a standard for calculation than anything else.  There are
better sky models floating about, but no official groups have yet gotten
together and put their stamp of approval on them.

Luminance can be computed from spectral radiance in Radiance with the
approximate formula:

	cd/m^2 = 179 lumens/watt * (.265*R + .670*G + .065*B)

Note that the default output of gensky is achromatic.  This is simply so that
renderings come out white-balanced.  Since most people are after a picture
rather than 4 digit accuracy, this is the default.

The meaning of red, green and blue in Radiance is somewhat vague, and this
is intentional.  You can in fact define these to be whatever you want.  If
you wish that they represent integrated spectral power from lambda1 to lambda2,
then that's what they represent.  Of course, you have to figure out what to
do with the pictures produced, as well as how to set the material reflectances
appropriately, but the calculation is the same.

Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.  You might also try looking
through the back issues of the Radiance digest, available by anonymous
ftp from hobbes.lbl.gov in the /pub/digest directory, or conveniently indexed
from our WWW site:

Hi Greg, 
I'm trying your Radiance package to measure light efficiency in
greenhouses under cloudy sky conditions. I'm specifically interested in
the ratio between the light measured in a point just above the greenhouse
and the light measured in a number of points 2 meters above the ground
inside the greenhouse. I have some questions considering these
simulations. 

Plants respond to the same portion of the spectrum as the human eye. But
the human eye reponds best to green-yellow light while plants respond best
to red-orange light. Furthermore,the response curve of the human eye is
more or less a Gaussian curve while the responsecurve of a plant follows a
saw-tooth. Am I right to say that I should not measure luminance like
(.3*r + .59*g + .11*b) {watts} * 470 {lumens/watt} but substitute the rgb
multipliers by other values to measure the light plants like best? How,
thereupon, should I measure this specific light in points two meters above
the ground? 

What exactly is the use of specifying a groundglow in addition to a
skyglow. Is it to simulate reflection of light by air molecules? 

I read once that for glass, the 8% difference between 96% (transmission
through the medium itself) and 88% (transmissivity) is due to reflection,
and it varies with incident angle. Does this mean the 88% is a mean
percentage for all possible angles of incidence, in other words, is it the
percentage of light coming through the glass under diffuse lighting
conditions ? (the conditions I'm interested in). 

Regards,

Maurice Bierhuizen.

Subject: Re:  green-house questions

Hi Maurice,

You are correct that you should not use photometric units (luminance
or illuminance) to gauge the amount of plant-food light in a space.
I don't know what factors you should use.  However, it really doesn't
matter unless your glass is tinted, because light is transmitted evenly
over the visible spectrum for clear glazing.

The 88% transmittance value is at normal (i.e. perpendicular) incidence,
and the amount transmitted will decrease at higher incident angles.  Radiance
accounts for this variation, and asks that the user specify the transmission
(amount of light not absorbed in one pass through the material) at normal
incidence and (optionally) the index of refraction for the glass type.

The ground glow accounts for light reflected from the ground towards the
horizon, assuming that you have some local geometry for the ground in the
vicinity of your model.  It is not advisable in Radiance to specify the entire
Earth as local geometry, as the difference between the largest and smallest
object is then too great for the octree structure to manage.

I hope this helps, and I wish you luck with your investigation.  I assume you
are using rtrace in your calculations.

[P.S.  I have been having a long discussion with Tony Yuricich about an
advanced sky model he's been working on, and hopefully he will provide
some code for us all in the coming months.  I didn't include that
conversation here because it was very specific and went on and on.]

I am a lighting designer in Nashville.  I spoke with you on the phone a few
months ago about Radiance.  I am considering installing A/UX on my Centris

Subject: Re:  Disk space for Radiance

Hi Dan,

A/UX itself requires about 120 Megs of disk space, and you should have at
least 20 Megs of RAM installed to be comfortable.  Radiance uses about 40
Megs of disk space on top of this, and I operate A/UX comfortably on a
160 Mbyte external drive.  You can buy one from Apple with A/UX already
installed, and it will save you some hassle (at the expense of a rather
steep price per megabyte.)

There are no quirks that I know of running Radiance under A/UX.  Unfortunately,
Apple does not plan to carry their A/UX product to the PowerPC platform, which
to my mind is really ideally suited to it.  Instead, they're going to let their
former enemy, IBM, service the PowerMac with their persnickity AIX product.
Radiance will run in this environment, but compiling it is a bit tricky because
the compiler is so cranky.  Also, AIX offers no access to your Macintosh
applications, a key benefit of A/UX.

I have no plans myself to port Radiance to the native Macintosh OS, though
I just spoke yesterday with someone who might.  It may happen, but not
right away.

Hi Greg,

maybe  you  remember me.  I was the the one who wanted to port Radiance
to the Amiga half a year ago.

While  my  first  attempt  did  not  work as I expected (I was too busy
trying  to  convert  Radiance'  K&amp;R-C  into  ANSI-C, my fault).  Then I
concacted  Per Bojsen in Denmark who made the first port and he told me

year  went  by  and nothing happened.  So I started to compile Radiance
again.  And guess what:  I now have a running and stable Radiance :-)

I  am  going to upload my Amiga version to hobbes.lbl.gov including the
slightly  modified sources.  I had to make small changes like inserting
a '#include <stdlib.h>' and the like.

Now my question:  I would like to upload a complete package of Radiance

Hi Greg,

I dont forward this to the discussion groupe because I dont think its so 
intersting to that forum.

I have changed 2 parameters in my rpict bat file, in order to get a 
&quot;cleaner&quot; picture (more round contor lines of falsecolor).
my old parameters were : -lr 8 -lw 0.005 -as 1024 -ad 512 -ar 4 -aa .1  
-ab 4 -st .01 -ps 1 -dj .75 -pt .001
my new parameters are the same except for -aa .05 &amp; -ab 6.
With the old parameters together with a uniform cloudy sky and a 4x3 room 
with a skylight window (not using illum function), it took about 10 hours 
to generate a picture.
With the new parameters it took 48 hours to complete 94.68 % of the 
picture but then I got a message: system out of memory in doambient,
Radiance stub failed.
Can you tell me why this happened and if there is any way to check such 
thing in advance?
What would be your advise , in order to get a better (but realistic) contour

Hi Shaul,

You ran out of memory because you are storing so many values.  You should
probably increase -ad to 1024 and reduce -as to 512, use -ab 3 instead of
6 and set -aa to .1.

Unfortunately, there's no way to know in advance how long a rendering is
going to take or how much memory it will use.  You just have to learn
from experience with your particular problems.  It varies quite a lot
from one scene to the next.

I would also recommend that you set the -av parameter to something non-zero,
for more accurate results.  You can use a zonal cavity approximation to
do this in most cases.  It's a bit difficult to do this for daylighting
situations, unfortunately, but the formula I recommend is:

	ambient_value = (Sum_i PHI_i)/(pi * A_total) * <rho>/(1 - <rho>)

where:
	Sum_i PHI_i	= sum of all source output flux (in watts)
	A_total		= total surface area of all surfaces
	<rho>		= area-weighted average of surface reflectance

Subject: Re: Radiance farming.

Hey folks,

I don't know why your renderings are taking so long, but somehow I feel that
I'm to blame.  (Now why is that?)

I've been doing a bunch of renderings myself, lately, and they do take a
while but I don't think I'd ever wait 400+ hours for a single picture!
The last high-quality 1000x700 (or so) picture I generated took about
10 hours on my SGI Indigo R4000, and it was a fairly complex space.

Since I want to encourage people to use rad (and the new GUI trad), I feel
I should give some appropriate hints on minimizing rendering time or at
least understanding why a particular rendering is taking so darned long.

As most of you know already, the indirect calculation in Radiance is what
makes it special and also what can make it especially slow if you're not
careful about how you apply it.  Using rad, most of the so-called
&quot;ambient&quot; parameters (-a*) are derived from the following variables.
I have arranged their values in order of least to most costly in
calculation time:

	QUALITY=	Low	Medium	High
	INDIRECT=	0	1	2	3	...
	VARIABILITY=	Low	Medium	High
	DETAIL=		Low	Medium	High

In addition to the above rad variables, the PENUMBRAS variable if set to
&quot;True&quot; will significantly slow down most renderings.  The RESOLUTION
setting also has some effect, though not as much as you would suppose.
Also, setting the AMBFILE variable is generally a good idea, since it
improves the results noticeably without increasing rendering time by
much.  In fact, for multiple renderings of the same scene, rad will
proceed much faster with an ambient file.

Now, let me explain a bit how the above variables affect calculation time.
The QUALITY variable has the greatest effect on rendering time, which is
why I listed it first.  A low quality rendering NEVER uses the indirect
calculation, regardless of the setting of the INDIRECT variable, unless
overridden by the render options variable.  (We'll discuss when you might
want to do this a little later.)  A medium quality rendering uses as many
bounces as indicated by the INDIRECT setting, and a high quality rendering
uses INDIRECT+1 bounces in its calculation.  Even more significant is
how the QUALITY variable changes all the other rendering parameters that
affect accuracy.  Since these changes are too numerous to list exhaustively,
suffice it to say that there's a BIG difference between the times and
results for different settings of the QUALITY variable.

The next most important variable after INDIRECT, which controls the
number of bounces in the calculation (along with the QUALITY setting as
described above), is the VARIABILITY variable.  This tells rad just how
hard it is to compute the indirect component at any given point in the
scene.  If the variability is low, then we don't have to send as many
samples around to figure out the indirect contribution.  If VARIABILITY
is set to medium, then we send about three times as many samples, and
space our calculations more closely.  If VARIABILITY is set to high
(something I don't recommend unless you have direct sun penetrating
your space), then about 1500 samples will be sent out at each
calculation point, and there will be roughly 4 times as many of these
points as there would be with a low setting.  Therefore, all else being
equal, you should expect a VARIABILITY=High calculation to take roughly
25 times as long as a VARIABILITY=Low calculation -- something to
think about!

Finally, the DETAIL variable has a modest effect on the calculation time,
as it controls the &quot;ambient resolution&quot; calculation parameter, which
determines the minimum spacing between indirect calculation points.
A low detail sene means we can afford to limit our indirect value density
to a modest level compared to a medium or high detail scene.  The precise
effect this will have depends on the geometry of the particular scene,
but it generally doesn't have more than a 10 times effect moving from
a low to a high setting.

Unfortunately, the above information is not enough to predict how long
a given rendering will take to complete.  (The best indicator still is
the time elapsed so far and how much has finished, as given by rpict's
reporting facility.)  However, there are some important scene-related
factors that we should consider.

The most important scene characteristic that affects rendering time is
geometric detail.  (Note that this would seem to contradict my placement
of the DETAIL variable as the least important setting.  While it is true
that the setting of this variable has a minor effect, the ACTUAL scene
detail has a rather major one.  In other words, changing the DETAIL
variable from &quot;medium&quot; to &quot;high&quot; might double the rendering time, but
increasing the actual scene complexity will have a much greater effect.)
This is because Radiance adjusts the calculation of indirect illumination
to the local scene complexity, unlike most radiosity rendering algorithms.
(Thus Radiance maintains accuracy with the minimum effort.)  Increasing
the number of do-dads and knick-knacks therefore increases the number of
indirect calculation points required to maintain accuracy.  A worst-case
scenario for Radiance is something like a packed forest, where every pine
needle is participating in the indirect calculation.

In scenes of such complexity, a different approach is required, and
that's when we bring in the render variable to override some of the
settings determined by rad.  In the worst-case of a forest given above,
we would probably want to turn off the indirect value storage and
interpolation altogether, and greatly reduce the number of sample
rays sent out, i.e:

	render= -ab 1 -aa 0 -ad 10 -as 0

Here we are forcing a 1-bounce calculation (more than that would be
painful), set -aa to 0 to turn off interpolation, and using just 10 samples
over the hemisphere at each point.  The resulting picture will be somewhat
noisy, but a forest is not a visually quiet place, so chances are no one
will notice.  (And if a tree falls, no one will hear it.)

The second, more common case encountered is one where most of the geometry
is fairly plain, consisting of walls, furniture and the like, but parts of
the scene are incredibly detailed, like rows and rows of books in an
enormous bookcase.  We want to use our indirect interpolation technique
to get the smoothest possible results over most of the scene, but if we
apply it also to the bookcase, our rendering will never finish.  What you
should do in such a case is employ the &quot;ambient selection&quot; options,
-ae and -aE to explicitly exclude materials from the indirect calculation,
or -ai and -aI to include them.  (You can use only one set or the other.)
Thus, you &quot;remove&quot; the offending objects from consideration (giving them
the default -av ambient value), speeding the overall calculation.  Since
the objects removed have a large amount of geometric detail, the loss in
illumination detail will probably go unnoticed.  I use this technique all
the time in my own renderings, and it is one of the chief tricks that make
high-quality renderings tractable.  (Ultimately, a better solution would
be automatic geometric simplification, but the problems involved are
nasty, nasty and nasty.)  For example, let's say we had venetian blinds on
the window that were slowing down our nighttime calculation.  The material
used for the blind slats is called &quot;slat_mat&quot;.  We would then add the
following setting to our render variable:

	render= -ae slat_mat

If there were other materials involved, we could list them in additional
-ae options, or use an -aE &quot;file&quot; option, where the file contains a list
of the appropriate materials.

I hope this helps to shed some light on a very murky subject.

-Greg

P.S.  In answer to Simon Crone's question about running rpiece more elegantly,
I usually use the OPTFILE variable of rad to create a rendering options file,
then apply that to rpiece, like so:

	% rad -n -s scene.rif OPTFILE=scene.opt
	% rpiece @scene.opt [other options] scene.oct &amp;

so I can't use that. I'll E-mail you a uuencoded image file; I'm sure it's 
something simple. The material I'm using is

void metal CHAMPAGNE
0
0
5 0.7 0.641 0.58 1 .4

and yes, I know that you don't recommend a roughness greater than 0.2,
but it doesn't seem to make a lot of difference. I'm trying to create
some approximation of metallic paint, which gets its main color from
metal and pigment particles suspended in the binder, but includes a
clear coat that reflects in an ideal specular fashion. I haven't dug
into this deeply enough to see if I can do this directly in Radiance;
I would like a &quot;metal&quot; with a &quot;plastic&quot; or &quot;glass&quot; overlayed.

By the way, it would be helpful if your documentation could be
expanded; at least tell me what the default value is for each
parameter, so I have some idea whether I've tweaked it or not. Any
further elucidation as to the function of each would also help.
