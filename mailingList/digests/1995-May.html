Dear Radiance Users, 

This is the second part of the Radiance Digest (v2n8), and it contains
only one topic. If you got it before the first part, it may be a quirk
or it may be that your mailer rejected the longer message. If you
suspect the latter, send me e-mail asking me to resend it to you.

<A HREF="v2n8_2.html#IRRADIANCE_GRADIENT">IRRADIANCE GRADIENT CALCULATION </A>

As usual, please do not respond to this message. If you have something
to tell me, write to &quot;GJWard@lbl.gov&quot;. If you wish to have
your name removed from the list, or someone else's name added, send
e-mail to:

radiance-request@hobbes.lbl.gov 

With some human-understandable message like: 

Please take my name off the Radiance Digest list. 

I receive these messages, and a single word like &quot;subscribe&quot;
means nothing, since there are two lists, a moderated digest list (the
one you are certainly on) and an unmoderated discussion list
(radiance-discuss@hobbes.lbl.gov).

Re: Irradiance Gradient method on surfaces with complex BRDF's

Hi Greg, 

I have been working with rendering/ray tracing for a while and I think
that Radiance is a very impressive program (the most impressive
rendering package on the net).

I have a question regaring the Irradiance Gradient method. As far as I
know it is currently limited to Lambertian surfaces. Has any work been
done towards extending it so that it could be used on surfaces with
more complex BRDF's (e.g. like Sillion's spherical harmonics
on surfaces with directional diffuse properties)? If not then how are
these complex surfaces dealt with - by plain recursive Monte Carlo
sampling - or via some Lambertian assumption?

I have a &quot;little&quot; extra question that I have been wondering
about.  How are caustics from refractive objects calculated. I know
that windows has been taken into account. But how about a pair of
glasses lying on a desk slightly focusing the light. I know that
radiance does not emit light rays from the light sources but is there a
way around this problem (e.g. polygonalization of the refractive
object) or are the caustics simulated using Monte Carlo sampling
perhaps combined with high lighting during refraction?

Best regards

Hi Henrik, 

The &quot;indirect irradiance&quot; calculation which makes use of
gradient approximations in Radiance does not consider the directional
reflectance of the surface on which the calculation takes place. It
considers only the diffuse component of its reflectance function, which
in some cases is small (even negligible). It does of course consider
the directional reflectances of other surfaces sampled over the
hemisphere, but only inasmuch as they affect the incoming
&quot;indirect&quot; radiation.

I know of no one who has extended the gradient work to more detailed
BRDF's, but the idea has merit. Remembering the trouble I had just
dealing with diffuse incidence with a simple sampling pattern, I'm not
sure I would want to tackle such a problem myself. Also, you must
remember that the principal problem with non-diffuse surfaces is that
their effect changes with the OUTGOING direction. Therefore, any work
you do on computing the gradient must be duplicated somehow for each
outgoing direction.

Caustics are not handled properly in Radiance. There are two reasons
for this. The first is that they simply are not very important in most
architectural environments. If light redirection is used, it is usually
done with mirrors or prisms rather than lenses. Radiance does handle
these cases. Second, caustics through refractive media are very
difficult in general to deal with. Radiance &quot;cops out&quot; by
following shadow test rays through the refractive surfaces (be they
flat or curved), and if they hit the source, great. If not, we consider
it a &quot;shadow&quot;, even though it's not.  This halfway approach
is exactly right for glass panes, but further from the truth the
further the glass is from a plate.

I hope this answers your questions.

Hi Greg, 

Thanks, for your fast reply... 

I agree that modifying the irradiance gradient method to account for
surfaces with directional reflection is a complex task. (The following
is just a thought...) A simple idea could perhaps be to use the old
irradiance technique without the gradient information (comp.  graph.
1988).  Instead of storing only the &quot;Lambertian intensity
constant&quot; one could use Sillion's spherical harmonics (comp.
graph. 1991) or perhaps Wavelets to store a complete intensity
distribution and then compute the interpolation/extrapolation of the
intensity from this distribution.  This would allow an efficient
simulation in models containing surfaces with directional diffuse
properties.

You are right that caustics aren't particularly important in practice
but still... I believe that caustics could be integrated rather easily
in Radiance as an external tool that would apply the light ray tracing
method introduced by Arvo in 1986. The tool or program could be used in
a preprocessing step and it should calculate the caustics values using
illumination maps. These illumination maps could then be integrated
into the rendering pipeline as texture maps with illumination
information. This would unfortunately be limited to Lambertian surfaces
but it would allow the simulation of caustics caused by the reflection
of light from a (small) water bassin. I guess this effect is also used
by some architects.  This kind of calculation must be somehow similar
to the skyillum-program (?) that calculates the indirect contribution
through windows. The tool would also fit nicely into the store and
reuse idea exploited in Radiance since the illumination maps are
view-independent and as such reusable.

A little extra question. Has anyone implemented fractal/procedural
objects in Radiance (e.g. plants) without approximating these with
polygons or other simple objects?

Hi Henrik, 

The main problem with storing information linked to directional
reflection is the amount of RAM it takes up. The diffuse+gradient
information stored in Radiance requires about 75-85 bytes/value, which
when you add up all the values to be computed is quite substantial.
Multiply that by a factor of at least 20 for spherical harmonics or the
like and you're all out of memory.  Swapping becomes the rule, as in
most radiosity calculations (even the ones just handle Lambertian
surfaces).

Your idea for integrating caustics is not too far-fetched, but again,
the cost of applying texture maps to EVERY surface is simply not
practical. Especially when you consider that many Radiance models
contain upwards of 100,000 surfaces, you can see why this might be a
problem. I feel it is essential to always look at the practical side of
the computation. Otherwise, you end up with something that no computer
can run.

I have not implemented any primitives other than polygons, spheres and
cones.  It is possible to do so, but you may find that the expense both
in terms of programming and in terms of rendering time is not worth the
effort. You can save some RAM by implementing higher-order primitives,
and maybe even improve the quality of your results, but you will
generally incur a large expense during rendering unless you are VERY
clever with your intersection procedure.

I recommend instead that you make use of the functionality already
built into gensurf, and check out the &quot;genpine.csh&quot; program
in the ray/src/gen directory as an example of building a fractal tree
using hierarchical instancing.

Hi Greg, 

I agree that spherical harmonics does indeed use a lot of memory.
However they should only be used on the (few) surfaces in the scene
that has directional reflection properties. Furthermore one might even
cut the memory requirements further down by using sp.ha. only at
intersections with primary rays or rather intersections seen by the eye
(that includes rays that have had one or more specular reflections).

The caustics idea could also be optimized a lot. Only surfaces
illuminated by caustics need a texture map (these surfaces could be
specified by the user).

One of the things I really like about Radiance are the rather advanced
materials and light sources. In order to use these properly I have been
looking for some material-database containing reflection-data for
common materials (metals, plastics etc.) but I have not been able to
find it. I was very pleased to see your 92-paper on Anisotropic
Reflection especially the tables of data measured from a range of
common materials. Since the article also presented equipment for
measuring reflection-properties I have been looking forward to seeing
some database containing measurements for different materials. I think
that this would be very useful since it could eliminate some of the
tentative part of designing scenes -- the creation of materials.
Does such a database exist?

Hi Henrik, 

Most of the surfaces are non-diffuse, unfortunately, so that won't help
reduce memory costs much. Primary rays still intersect many, many
thousands of surfaces. I don't really like these kinds of halfway,
compicated implementations, especially when my budget for Radiance
development has dropped to zero.

Your idea for texturing selected surfaces is exactly what I have in
mind for my next work on light source computations. The mkillum program
is a first attempt at that, though it still has trouble with some
interactions since it still runs rays backwards w.r.t. light.

Your ideas for databases are appreciated, and I agree that this is
sorely lacking. Ultimately, I believe it is the responsibility of
surface manufacturers to measure their own products, since there are
way too many for the research community to deal with them unaided. My
current work in this area is to develop and calibrate a portable
reflectance measurement device, that would permit field measurements of
surface materials in situ. I see this as the most practical short-term
solution to the problem, since the databases we both want don't seem to
be forthcoming.

Hi Greg, 

Most real-world surfaces are non-diffuse, but I think that our computer
models could settle with only a few &quot;important&quot; surfaces
being non-diffuse and since reflectance-data aren't available this
comes quite natural.

I agree that different materials ought to be measured by their
manufactors.  However computer graphics is quite new and it has not yet
proven useful in enough areas to make this realistic. Instead I believe
that your measurement device could be very useful in obtaining
reflectance data for common materials that would fit the
isotropic/anisotropic models.  I really believe the computer graphics
community could benifit a lot from this.  It would fx. make the
creation of standard scenes more realistic since we would be able to
talk about the same materials - instead of only Lambertian reflection.

I was browsing through the scenes following Radiance and I found some
reflectance data for gold, silver, brass, wood, etc. Are these
materials measured or just created in order to look good?

I am looking forward to seeing illumination maps in Radiance.  In my
own rendering program I have quite succesfully implemented light ray
tracing and combined it with the irradiance gradient method.

Some time ago I heard about a global illumination mailing list. Does
this mailing list still exist and if so, can I somehow join it?

Hi Henrik, 

As much as I would like to create a materials database, the real work
of collecting and cutting up suitable samples is beyond me. I wouldn't
know how to go about it. Perhaps you or someone could organize a
&quot;sample drive,&quot; where interested people sent in appropriate
samples of various materials for me to measure. I don't want to do all
the work of cataloging everything, but I could probably handle the
actual measurement and fitting if there weren't too many samples to
deal with. This is a very tentative idea...  I'm nervous about taking
on any new projects without funding right now, as I have plenty to do
and not enough time to do it already.

I'm glad that you've managed to implement and use the irradiance
gradients in your code. You're the first I've heard from to do so.

Yes, the globillum list is still going. To sign up, send a request to
Paul Heckbert &lt;ph@cs.cmu.edu&gt; and say you want on it.

Hi Greg, 

I can see the problem of collecting material-samples. I would however
also think that measuring and fitting these materials would take a lot
of time.

I could see if I could get my hands on some materials like:  Bricks,
pieces of wall-paper, different types/colours of paint, plants? (grass,
leaves, bark...) Of course a number of these would have to be
accompanied by some texture mapping. Plants would be quite difficult to
sent - I guess the reflectance properties would change during air-mail
;-)

I wouldn't mind collecting a material database. I think the work of
cataloging the materials could simply be done (initially) using a
text-file containing names of materials and the corresponding
reflectance model and measured data - just like the tables you
presented in your paper at siggraph 92.

It surprises me that no one else has announced implementations of the
irradiance gradient method. I am very pleased with it. I started
initially with plain recursive Monte Carlo sampling which took years
(almost) to complete. Then I found your article on the store and reuse
technique in comp. graph. 1988 which I implemented and it was a large
improvement (It did however eat up a bit of memory). A few month later
I found your article on the irradiance gradient method which was again
a large improvement and it gave very good results.

Hi Greg, 

It could indeed be very interesting to arrange a sample drive.  I can
think about a number of materials that could be quite interesting to
measure: Bricks, different types/colours of wall-paper, different
types/colours of paint, plants (I don't know whether they fit into the
model). I wouldn't mind cataloging these materials. I think it can be
done (initially) simply by adding information to a text-file regarding
the material name and the measured reflectance data.

It surprises me that no one else has announced implementations of the
irradiance gradient method. It has been very useful to me. I started
initially with plain Monte Carlo sampling of the indirect light (it
took years to complete). Then I found your article in comp. graph. 88
concerning storing and reusing the indirect light which I implemented
with very good results. Later I found your 92 article with the gradient
technique and it gave even better results. I think that for instance
Chen in comp. graph. 91 could benifit from the irradiance gradients
method instead of using path tracing in the visualization step.

I have read in your articles that the results in Radiance are verified
from time to time (and they improve). How is this verification done.
Is it via a simple model that can be handled with exact calculations or
is it via a brute force Monte Carlo technique?

Hi Henrik, 

Sorry not to respond to your last message, but there are so many
problems with creating a material database that I haven't solved yet,
that I don't even want to think about it right now. (Material textures
and colors are BIG problems.)

Radiance has been compared to measurements of scale models, other
lighting simulations and measurements and qualitative comparisons of
full-sized environments. Most of the good validation work has been done
outside of LBL.

Hi Henrik, 

The problem with colors and textures is that the device I currently
have can neither measure nor ignore them. They interfere with the
measurements, especially surfaces with visible textures or patterns.

There are a couple of reports with Radiance validation data in them.
One is by John Mardaljevic:

Mardaljevic, John, K.J. Lomas, D.G. Henderson, ``Advanced
Daylighting
Design for Complex Spaces'' Proceedings of CLIMA 2000, 1-3
November
1993, London UK. 

Two others come from LBL: 

Grynberg, Anat, Validation of Radiance, LBID 1575, LBL
Technical
Information Department, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley,
California, July 1989. 

Papamichael, Kostantinos, Liliana Beltran,
``Simulating the Daylight Performance of Fenestration
Systems and Spaces of Arbitrary Complexity: The IDC Method''
&quot;Proceedings of Building Simulation `93&quot;,
Adelaide, Australia, August 16-18, 1993. 

Don't ask me to send Anat's to you. It's rather long, and the color
images don't copy well. These papers are not the best resource if what
you want to do is validate your own software, however. You would be
better off using the simulations that lie in the /pub/tests directory
on hobbes.lbl.gov. That's what they're there for.
